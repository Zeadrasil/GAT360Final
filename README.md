# GAT360Final

From the minds of  David Griffith, Michelle Barker, Dakota Partney and Zane Ammerman we present Lava Tower. A challenging parkor adventure combatting cultists while you avoid the ever rising threat. You'll need to rely on swift decisions and precise movements if you hope to climb and escape this melting prison. Use your mouse and WASD or your arrow keys to move around the tower while pressing space to jump across the gaps. Watch out for enemies as well, for you will need to use tab to switch to your heavy sword if you wish to defeat them and progress towards safety.
